# The OAD Data Science Toolkit Website
These are the files for the [OAD Astronomy & Data Science Toolkit Website](http://datascience.astro4dev.org).

## Translations
The toolkit website allows for community to add translations. Ideally this is done via GitHub by forkng this repository, making the changes, and submitting a pull request. More information on this is found under _How to upload content via GitHub_ which is available [here](https://github.com/astro4dev/OAD-Data-Science-Toolkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You will find the parts which need translating by looking through the source code of index.php and toolkit.php and looking for ```html <!-- [LANGUAGE] -->```

Here is an example:

```html
<!-- ENGLISH -->
<h1 lang="en">Astronomy & Data Science Toolkit</h1>
<p lang="en">Connecting Astronomy and Data Science</p>

<!-- SPANISH -->
<h1 lang="es">Toolkit de Astronomía y Ciencia de Datos</h1>
<p lang="es">Conexión de la astronomía y la ciencia de los datos</p>
```
 Should you not find your desired language, then please copy and paste the English entry and edit this one. Remember to add the correct country code to the language tag. For instance if you wish to contribute in French make sure you change ```html lang="en"``` to ```html lang="fr"```.
