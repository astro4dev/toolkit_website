								<h2>About the toolkit</h2>
								<p>More specifically, the toolkit will provide
<ul>
<li>A map to existing data science resources, so that those planning data science instruction programmes in astronomy are aware of what has already been done and what can be covered.</li>
<li>A high quality teaching resources and assessments, for student- and self-assessment.</li>
<li>Instructors with easily accessible guidance and further information on how to teach effectively and inclusively.</li>
</ul>

The Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) is a global office that is mandated to use astronomy to drive positive developmental change. This office was established through a joint partnership between the <a href="https://www.iau.org/" target="_top">International Astronomical Union (IAU)</a> and the South African <a href="http://www.nrf.ac.za/" target="_top">National Research Foundation (NRF)</a>. It was inaugurated on 16 April 2011 at its location in the South African Astronomical Observatory. The purpose of the OAD is to implement the IAU’s Strategic plan 2010-2020 “Astronomy for Development”. This plan describes the potential of Astronomy to contribute to sustainable development. The OAD was established to mobilise the necessary human and financial resources in order to realise the field’s scientific, technological and cultural benefits to society.</p>

<p>
The OAD is tasked with establishing and strategically coordinating Regional Offices and Language Expertise Centres across the world, as well as initiating, supporting and funding programmes in three core areas: Astronomy for Universities and Research, Astronomy for Children and Schools, and Astronomy for the Public.</p>

For more information on the OAD including current projects and how you can contribute please visit <a href="http://www.astro4dev.org/" target="_top">www.astro4dev.org</a>.
